# Awesome Skills: Free, Ready-to-Use Toolkit

Welcome to the `x-cmd/skill` repository! This is a curated collection of skills designed to boost what AI agents can do. While we started with Claude Code in mind, you'll find these skills work just as well with other AI agents, helping them tackle tasks more efficiently.

## What Guides Us

We're building this repository with a clear focus on quality and collaboration:

- **Human-Curated Quality:** Every skill here gets careful human review to make sure it's reliable and actually useful in practice.
- **Community-Powered:** We're growing through community contributions, creating a space where we can all learn and build together.

**A Note on Licensing**

Most of what you'll find here uses the Apache License 2.0. However, some skills like the Anthropic document skills or Notion skills have different licenses. For these, we include them in our index but don't store copies in the data folder. When using these skills, please respect their specific license terms.

## Thanks to Our Contributors

This project wouldn't be possible without the people who've shared their skills and improvements. Your contributions make this repository valuable!
