# x-cmd/skill: AI Agent Skills Collection

This repository contains a curated collection of skills for AI agents. While originally developed for Claude Code, these skills work with various AI agents to help them handle tasks more effectively.

## Our Approach

This repository is built with a focus on quality and collaboration:

- **Human-Curated Quality:** Each skill undergoes careful review to ensure reliability and practical usefulness.
- **Community-Powered:** We grow through community contributions, creating a collaborative space for learning and building together.

## Licensing

Most content in this repository uses the Apache License 2.0. However, some skills (such as Anthropic document skills or Notion skills) have different licenses. These are included in our index but not stored in the data folder. Please respect the specific license terms when using these skills.

## Data Storage Policy

We prefer storing skill data within the repository rather than referencing external sources for three main reasons:

- **License Consistency:** Hosting data directly ensures it's covered by our Apache 2.0 license, maintaining consistent licensing across the repository.
- **Integrity Assurance:** Storing data in the repository allows thorough code reviews and guarantees content remains unchanged over time, protecting against potential tampering or unexpected modifications in external sources.
- **Convenient Access:** Users can download all skill data at once using git, instead of downloading each skill individually through multiple web services.
