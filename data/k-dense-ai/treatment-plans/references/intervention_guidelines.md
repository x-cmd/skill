# Evidence-Based Intervention Guidelines

## Overview

This reference provides comprehensive guidance on selecting, implementing, and documenting evidence-based interventions across pharmacological, non-pharmacological, and procedural treatment modalities. These guidelines support treatment plan development with current best practices and clinical recommendations.

## Evidence Hierarchy

### Levels of Evidence

**Level I: Highest Quality**
- Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs)
- Large multi-center RCTs

**Level II: High Quality**
- Individual RCTs
- Systematic reviews of observational studies

**Level III: Moderate Quality**
- Cohort studies
- Case-control studies
- Well-designed observational studies

**Level IV: Lower Quality**
- Case series
- Case reports
- Expert opinion

**Recommendation Strength**:
- **Grade A**: Strong recommendation, high-quality evidence
- **Grade B**: Moderate recommendation, moderate-quality evidence  
- **Grade C**: Weak recommendation, low-quality evidence
- **Grade D**: Recommendation against (evidence of harm or no benefit)

## Pharmacological Interventions

### Medication Selection Principles

#### 1. Evidence-Based Prescribing
- Use medications with proven efficacy for indication
- Follow clinical practice guidelines
- Consider comparative effectiveness data
- Prefer medications with better safety profiles when equivalent efficacy

#### 2. Patient-Specific Factors
- Comorbidities and contraindications
- Organ function (renal, hepatic)
- Drug allergies and intolerances
- Concurrent medications (drug interactions)
- Age, pregnancy status
- Genetic factors (pharmacogenomics when available)
- Cost and insurance coverage

#### 3. Medication Safety
- Start low, go slow (especially in elderly, multiple comorbidities)
- Titrate to target dose based on response and tolerance
- Monitor for adverse effects
- Avoid potentially inappropriate medications (Beers Criteria for elderly)
- Polypharmacy reduction when possible

### Common Medication Classes by Indication

#### Hypertension

**First-Line Agents** (per JNC-8, ACC/AHA guidelines):
- **ACE Inhibitors** (lisinopril, enalapril): Preferred if diabetes, CKD, or heart failure
- **ARBs** (losartan, valsartan): Alternative to ACE if intolerant
- **Calcium Channel Blockers** (amlodipine): Particularly effective in elderly, Black patients
- **Thiazide Diuretics** (chlorthalidone, HCTZ): Cost-effective, good CV outcomes

**Dosing Strategy**:
- Start single agent at low dose
- Titrate to maximum tolerated dose before adding second agent
- Combination therapy often needed (2-3 agents)
- Monitor BP response, adjust every 2-4 weeks

#### Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus

**First-Line** (ADA Standards of Care):
- **Metformin**: First-line for all patients unless contraindicated (eGFR <30)
  - Start 500-850mg daily or BID, titrate to 2000mg total daily

**Second-Line** (individualize based on comorbidities):
- **SGLT2 Inhibitors** (empagliflozin, dapagliflozin): If heart failure or CKD (strong cardio-renal benefits)
- **GLP-1 Receptor Agonists** (semaglutide, dulaglutide): If ASCVD or high risk, weight loss needed
- **DPP-4 Inhibitors** (sitagliptin): If low hypoglycemia risk desired
- **Sulfonylureas** (glipizide): Cost-effective but hypoglycemia risk
- **Insulin**: If HbA1c very elevated ($>$10%) or symptoms of hyperglycemia

#### Depression

**First-Line SSRIs** (APA guidelines):
- Sertraline, escitalopram, fluoxetine, citalopram, paroxetine
- Start low (e.g., sertraline 50mg, escitalopram 10mg)
- Titrate after 2-4 weeks if partial response
- Full trial: 6-8 weeks at therapeutic dose
- Continue 6-12 months after remission (longer if recurrent)

**Second-Line**:
- **SNRIs** (venlafaxine, duloxetine): Especially if chronic pain comorbidity
- **Bupropion**: If sexual dysfunction concern, smoking cessation
- **Mirtazapine**: If insomnia/appetite stimulation needed

**Augmentation** (if partial response):
- Second antidepressant from different class
- Atypical antipsychotic (aripiprazole, quetiapine) - FDA-approved augmentation
- Lithium, thyroid hormone (triiodothyronine)

#### Chronic Pain

**Multimodal Analgesia** (WHO Pain Ladder, CDC Opioid Guidelines):

**Non-Opioid Analgesics**:
- **Acetaminophen**: 3-4g/day divided, safe if liver function normal
- **NSAIDs**: Ibuprofen, naproxen, meloxicam - short-term or chronic with GI protection
  - Monitor: Renal function, BP, GI bleeding risk

**Adjuvant Analgesics for Neuropathic Pain**:
- **Gabapentin**: 300mg titrated to 1800-3600mg/day divided TID
- **Pregabalin**: 75mg BID titrated to 150-300mg BID (better bioavailability than gabapentin)
- **SNRIs** (duloxetine): 60mg daily for diabetic neuropathy, chronic MSK pain
- **TCAs** (amitriptyline, nortriptyline): Low-dose (10-75mg QHS) - second-line due to side effects

**Topical Agents**:
- Lidocaine patches 5%, diclofenac gel, capsaicin cream
- Local effect, minimal systemic absorption

**Opioids** (CDC guidelines - use cautiously):
- Only after non-opioid multimodal therapies inadequate
- Lowest effective dose, short-acting preferred initially
- Avoid $>$90 MME/day if possible
- UDS, PDMP monitoring, naloxone co-prescription
- Reassess frequently, taper if not meeting functional goals

#### Heart Failure with Reduced Ejection Fraction (HFrEF)

**Guideline-Directed Medical Therapy (GDMT)** - "Foundational Four":

1. **ACE Inhibitor or ARB or ARNI**
   - ACE: Lisinopril 20-40mg daily, enalapril 10-20mg BID
   - ARNI (Sacubitril/Valsartan): 24/26mg BID → 97/103mg BID (superior to ACE/ARB)
   - Monitor: BP, renal function, potassium

2. **Beta-Blocker**
   - Carvedilol 3.125-6.25mg BID → 25mg BID (target)
   - Metoprolol succinate 12.5-25mg daily → 200mg daily
   - Bisoprolol 1.25mg → 10mg daily
   - Titrate slowly, monitor HR, BP

3. **Mineralocorticoid Receptor Antagonist (MRA)**
   - Spironolactone 12.5-25mg daily (up to 50mg)
   - Eplerenone 25mg daily → 50mg daily
   - Monitor: Potassium, renal function (risk hyperkalemia)

4. **SGLT2 Inhibitor**
   - Dapagliflozin 10mg daily or empagliflozin 10mg daily
   - Reduces HF hospitalizations and mortality
   - Also beneficial for diabetes and CKD

**Additional Therapies**:
- Loop diuretic (furosemide) for volume management (not mortality benefit)
- Hydralazine-isosorbide dinitrate (if African American or intolerant to ACE/ARB)
- Ivabradine (if EF $\leq$35%, HR $>$70 on max beta-blocker)
- Digoxin (symptomatic benefit, reduce hospitalizations)

### Medication Documentation Best Practices

**Include in Treatment Plan**:
- Generic name (brand name optional)
- Dose, route, frequency
- Indication/rationale
- Titration plan if applicable
- Expected timeline for benefit
- Key side effects to monitor
- Drug interactions
- When to adjust or discontinue

**Example**: "Lisinopril 10mg PO daily - ACE inhibitor for hypertension and renal protection in diabetes. Titrate to 20mg in 2-4 weeks if BP not at goal and tolerating (monitor for cough, hyperkalemia). Target BP <130/80."

## Non-Pharmacological Interventions

### Lifestyle Modifications

#### Diet and Nutrition

- Dietitian teaches carb counting skills

**Weight Management**:
- Caloric deficit: 500-750 kcal/day for 1-2 lb/week weight loss
- Behavior change strategies: Self-monitoring, stimulus control, goal-setting
- Structured programs (Weight Watchers, MOVE!, etc.) more effective than self-directed
- Pharmacotherapy (GLP-1 agonists, orlistat) or bariatric surgery for BMI $\geq$30-35 with comorbidities

#### Physical Activity and Exercise

**Aerobic Exercise**:
- **Recommendation**: 150 min/week moderate intensity OR 75 min/week vigorous
- **Moderate**: Brisk walking, cycling, swimming - can talk but not sing
- **Vigorous**: Running, fast cycling - can say few words before pause
- **Benefits**: Cardiovascular health, glucose control, weight management, mood
- **Implementation**: Start with 10 min sessions, gradually increase

**Resistance Training**:
- **Recommendation**: 2-3 sessions/week, all major muscle groups
- **Benefits**: Muscle strength, bone density, metabolic rate, glucose control
- **Implementation**: Bodyweight exercises, resistance bands, free weights, machines

**Balance and Flexibility**:
- Important for fall prevention in elderly
- Yoga, tai chi
- Stretching routines

**Exercise Prescription**:
- FITT principle: **F**requency, **I**ntensity, **T**ime, **T**ype
- Individualize based on fitness level, comorbidities, goals
- Cardiac clearance if indicated (using ACSM or ACC/AHA guidelines)

**Example**: "Aerobic exercise: Walk 30 minutes, 5 days/week at moderate intensity (target HR 50-70% max). Resistance training: Upper and lower body exercises 2x/week, 2 sets of 10-12 reps."

#### Smoking Cessation

**Evidence**: Strongest intervention for COPD, cardiovascular disease, cancer prevention

**5 A's Approach**:
1. **Ask**: Screen all patients for tobacco use
2. **Advise**: Urge all tobacco users to quit
3. **Assess**: Willingness to make quit attempt
4. **Assist**: Aid in quitting (counseling + medication)
5. **Arrange**: Follow-up contact

**Pharmacotherapy** (doubles quit rates):
- **Nicotine Replacement**: Patch, gum, lozenge - OTC, safe
- **Varenicline**: Most effective (Chantix), start 1 week before quit date
- **Bupropion**: Alternative, also treats depression
- **Combination**: NRT + varenicline/bupropion more effective

**Counseling**:
- Quitline: 1-800-QUIT-NOW
