### Adaptation Checklist

When preparing any talk, consider:

- [ ] Who is my audience? (Expertise level, background, expectations)
- [ ] How much time do I have? (Strictly enforced or flexible?)
- [ ] What is the goal? (Inform, persuade, teach, impress?)
- [ ] What format is expected? (Formal vs. interactive, Q&A style)
- [ ] What will happen afterward? (Q&A, discussion, evaluation, networking)
- [ ] What are the logistics? (Room size, A/V setup, recording, remote?)

Adapt your structure, content depth, language, and delivery style accordingly.
