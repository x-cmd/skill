# Presentation Structure Guide

## Overview

Effective scientific presentations follow a clear narrative structure that guides the audience through your research story. This guide provides structure templates for different talk lengths and contexts, helping you organize content for maximum impact and clarity.

## Core Narrative Structure

All scientific presentations should follow a story arc that engages, informs, and persuades:

1. **Hook**: Grab attention immediately (30 seconds - 1 minute)
2. **Context**: Establish the research area and importance (5-10% of talk)
3. **Problem/Gap**: Identify what's unknown or problematic (5-10% of talk)
4. **Approach**: Explain your solution or method (15-25% of talk)
5. **Results**: Present key findings (40-50% of talk)
6. **Implications**: Discuss meaning and impact (15-20% of talk)
7. **Closure**: Memorable conclusion and call to action (1-2 minutes)

This arc mirrors the scientific method while maintaining narrative flow that keeps audiences engaged.

## Slide Count Guidelines

**General Rule**: Approximately 1 slide per minute, with adjustments based on content complexity.

| Talk Duration | Total Slides | Title/Intro | Methods | Results | Discussion | Conclusion |
|---------------|--------------|-------------|---------|---------|------------|------------|
| 5 minutes (lightning) | 5-7 | 1-2 | 0-1 | 2-3 | 1 | 1 |
| 10 minutes (short) | 10-12 | 2 | 1-2 | 4-5 | 2-3 | 1 |
| 15 minutes (conference) | 15-18 | 2-3 | 2-3 | 6-8 | 3-4 | 1-2 |
| 20 minutes (extended) | 20-24 | 3 | 3-4 | 8-10 | 4-5 | 2 |
| 30 minutes (seminar) | 25-30 | 3-4 | 5-6 | 10-12 | 6-8 | 2 |
| 45 minutes (keynote) | 35-45 | 4-5 | 8-10 | 15-20 | 8-10 | 2-3 |
| 60 minutes (lecture) | 45-60 | 5-6 | 10-12 | 20-25 | 10-12 | 3-4 |

**Adjustments**:
- **Complex data**: Reduce slide count (spend more time per slide)
- **Simple concepts**: Can increase slide count slightly
- **Heavy animations**: Count as multiple slides if building incrementally
- **Q&A included**: Reduce content slides by 20-30%

## Opening Strategies

### The Hook (First 30-60 seconds)

Your opening sets the tone and captures attention. Effective hooks:

**1. Surprising Statistic**
- "Every year, X million people experience Y, yet only Z% receive effective treatment."
- Works well for applied research with societal impact

**2. Provocative Question**
- "What if I told you that everything we thought about X is wrong?"
- Engages audience immediately, creates curiosity

**3. Personal Story**
- "Five years ago, I encountered a patient/problem that changed how I think about..."
- Humanizes research, creates emotional connection

**4. Visual Puzzle**
- Start with an intriguing image or data visualization
- "Look at this pattern. What could explain it?"

**5. Contrasting Paradigms**
- "The traditional view says X, but new evidence suggests Y."
- Sets up tension and your contribution

**6. Scope and Scale**
- "This problem affects X people, costs Y dollars, and has been unsolved for Z years."
- Establishes immediate importance

### Title Slide Essentials

Your title slide should include:
- **Clear, specific title** (not generic)
- **Your name and credentials**
- **Affiliation(s) with logos**
- **Date and venue** (conference name)
- **Optional**: QR code to paper, slides, or resources
- **Optional**: Compelling background image related to research

**Title Crafting**:
- Be specific: "Machine Learning Predicts Alzheimer's Risk from Retinal Images" 
- Not vague: "Applications of AI in Healthcare"
- Include key method and outcome
- Maximum 15 words
- Avoid jargon if presenting to broader audience

### Outline Slides

For talks >20 minutes, include a brief outline slide:
- Shows 3-5 main sections
- Provides roadmap for audience
- Can return to outline as section dividers
- Keep simple and visual (not just bullet list)

Example outline approach:
```
[Icon] Background → [Icon] Methods → [Icon] Results → [Icon] Implications
```

## Closing Strategies

### Effective Conclusions

The last 1-2 minutes are most remembered. Strong conclusions:

**1. Key Takeaways Format**
- 3-5 bullet points summarizing main messages
- Each should be a complete, memorable sentence
- Not just "Results": make claims

**2. Call-Back Hook**
- Reference your opening hook or question
- "Remember that surprising statistic? Our findings suggest..."
- Creates narrative closure

**3. Practical Implications**
- "What does this mean for clinicians/researchers/policy?"
- Action-oriented takeaways
- Bridges science to application

**4. Visual Summary**
- Single powerful figure integrating all findings
- Conceptual model showing relationships
- Before/after comparison

**5. Future Outlook**
- "These findings open doors to..."
- 1-2 specific next steps
- Inspiration for audience's own work

### Acknowledgments Slide

Essential elements:
- **Funding sources** (with grant numbers)
- **Key collaborators** (with photos if space)
- **Institution/lab** (with logo)
- **Study participants** (appropriate mention)
- Keep brief (15-30 seconds max)
- Optional: Include contact info and QR codes here

### Final Slide

Your final slide stays visible during Q&A. Include:
- **"Thank you" or "Questions?"**
- **Your contact information** (email, Twitter/X)
- **QR code to paper, preprint, or slides**
- **Lab website or GitHub**
- **Key visual from your research** (not just text)

Avoid ending with "References" or dense acknowledgments—these don't facilitate discussion.

## Transition Techniques

Smooth transitions maintain narrative flow and audience orientation.

### Between Major Sections

**Explicit Transition Slides**:
- Use consistent visual style (color, icon, position)
- Single word or short phrase: "Methods" "Results" "Implications"
- Optional: Return to outline with current section highlighted

**Verbal Transitions**:
- "Now that we've established X, let's examine how we studied Y..."
- "With that background, I'll turn to our key findings..."
- "This raises the question: How did we measure this?"

### Between Related Slides

**Visual Continuity**:
- Repeat key element (figure, title format) across slides
- Use consistent color coding
- Progressive builds of same figure

**Verbal Bridges**:
- "Building on this finding..."
- "To test this further..."
- "This pattern was consistent across..."

### Signposting Language

Help audience track progress through talk:
- "First, I'll show... Second... Finally..."
- "There are three key findings to discuss..."
- "Now, let's turn to the most surprising result..."
- "Coming back to our original question..."

## Pacing and Timing

### Time Budgeting

**Plan timing for each slide**:
- Simple title/transition slides: 15-30 seconds
- Text content slides: 45-90 seconds
- Complex figures: 2-3 minutes
- Key results: 2-4 minutes each

**Common Timing Mistakes**:
- ❌ Spending too long on introduction (>15% of talk)
- ❌ Rushing through results (should be 40-50%)
- ❌ Not leaving time for questions
- ❌ Going over time (extremely unprofessional)

### Practice Strategies

**Full Run-Throughs** (Do 3-5 times):
1. **First run**: Rough timing, identify problem areas
2. **Second run**: Practice transitions, smooth language
3. **Third run**: Final timing with backup plans
4. **Recording**: Video yourself, watch for tics/filler words
5. **Audience practice**: Present to colleagues for feedback

**Section Practice**:
- Practice complex result slides multiple times
- Rehearse opening and closing until flawless
- Prepare ad-libs for common questions

**Timing Techniques**:
- Note target time at bottom of key slides
- Set phone/watch to vibrate at checkpoints
- Have Plan B: know which slides to skip if running over
- Practice with live timer visible

### Managing Time During Talk

**If Running Ahead** (rarely a problem):
- Expand on key points naturally
- Take questions mid-talk if appropriate
- Provide more context or examples
- Slow down slightly (but don't add filler)

**If Running Behind**:
- Skip backup slides or extra examples (prepare these in advance)
- Summarize rather than detail on secondary points
- Never rush through conclusions—skip earlier content instead
- NEVER say "I'll go quickly through these" (just skip them)

**Time Checkpoints**:
- 25% through talk = 25% through time
- 50% through talk = 50% through time
- After results = should have 5-10 minutes left
- Start conclusions with 2-3 minutes remaining

## Audience Engagement

### Reading the Room

**Visual Cues**:
- **Engaged**: Leaning forward, nodding, taking notes
- **Lost**: Confused expressions, checking phones
- **Bored**: Leaning back, glazed eyes, fidgeting

**Adjustments**:
- If losing audience: Speed up, add humor, show compelling visual
- If audience confused: Slow down, ask "Does this make sense?", re-explain
- If highly engaged: Can add more detail, encourage questions

### Interactive Elements

For seminars and longer talks:

**Rhetorical Questions**:
- "Why do you think this pattern occurred?"
- "What would you predict happens next?"
- Pauses for thought (don't immediately answer)

**Quick Polls** (if appropriate):
- "Raise your hand if you've encountered X..."
- "How many think the result will be A vs. B?"
- Brief, not disruptive

**Checkpoint Questions**:
- "Before I continue, are there questions about the methods?"
- "Is everyone comfortable with this concept?"
- For longer talks or tutorials

### Body Language and Delivery

**Effective Practices**:
- ✅ Stand to side of screen, facing audience
- ✅ Use pointer deliberately for specific elements
- ✅ Make eye contact with different sections of room
- ✅ Gesture naturally to emphasize points
- ✅ Vary voice pitch and pace
- ✅ Pause after important points

**Avoid**:
- ❌ Reading slides verbatim
- ❌ Turning back to audience
- ❌ Standing in front of projection
- ❌ Fidgeting with pointer/objects
- ❌ Pacing repetitively
- ❌ Monotone delivery

## Special Considerations

### Virtual Presentations

**Technical Setup**:
- Test screen sharing, audio, and video beforehand
- Use presenter mode if available (see notes)
- Ensure good lighting and camera angle
- Minimize background distractions

**Engagement Challenges**:
- Can't read audience body language as well
- More explicit engagement needed
- Use polls, chat, reactions if platform allows
- Encourage unmuting for questions

**Pacing**:
- Slightly slower pace (harder to interrupt virtually)
- More explicit transitions and signposting
- Build in planned pauses for questions
- Monitor chat for questions during talk

### Handling Questions

**During Talk**:
- For short talks: "Please hold questions until the end"
- For seminars: "Feel free to interrupt with questions"
- If interrupted: "Great question, let me finish this point and come back to it"

**Q&A Session**:
- **Listen fully** before answering
- **Repeat or rephrase** question for whole audience
- **Answer concisely** (30-90 seconds max)
- **Be honest** if you don't know: "That's a great question I don't have data on yet"
- **Redirect if off-topic**: "That's interesting but beyond scope. Happy to discuss after."
- **Have backup slides** with extra data/analyses ready

**Difficult Questions**:
- **Hostile**: Stay calm, acknowledge concern, stick to data
- **Confusing**: Ask for clarification: "Could you rephrase that?"
- **Out of scope**: "I focused on X, but your question about Y is important for future work"

### Technical Difficulties

**Preparation**:
- Have backup: PDF on laptop, cloud, and USB drive
- Test connections and adapters beforehand
- Know how to reset display if needed
- Have printout of slides as absolute backup

**During Talk**:
- Stay calm and professional
- Fill time with verbal explanation while fixing
- Skip problem slide if necessary
- Apologize briefly but don't dwell on it
