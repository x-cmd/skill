```
A 58-year-old male (Subject ID: 12345) enrolled in Study XYZ-301, a Phase 3
randomized trial of Drug X vs. placebo for heart failure. On Day 42 of treatment
(15-Feb-2024), the patient presented to the emergency department with sudden onset
severe chest pain, diaphoresis, and dyspnea. ECG showed ST-segment elevation in
leads V2-V4. Troponin I was elevated at 12.5 ng/mL (normal <0.04). The patient was
diagnosed with acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction and underwent emergent
cardiac catheterization revealing 95% occlusion of the left anterior descending
artery. Percutaneous coronary intervention with drug-eluting stent placement was
performed successfully. The patient was admitted to the cardiac intensive care unit.
Study drug was permanently discontinued on Day 42. The patient recovered and was
discharged on Day 47 (20-Feb-2024) in stable condition. This event was assessed as
unlikely related to study drug by the investigator, as the patient had significant
underlying coronary artery disease risk factors including diabetes, hypertension,
and smoking history.

### Regulatory Reporting Timelines

**FDA IND Safety Reporting (21 CFR 312.32):**
- **Fatal or life-threatening unexpected SAEs**: 7 calendar days for preliminary report, 15 days for complete report
- **Other serious unexpected events**: 15 calendar days
- **Annual safety reports**: Within 60 days of anniversary of IND

**EMA Expedited Reporting:**
- **Fatal or life-threatening unexpected events**: 7 days initial, 8 additional days for complete report
- **Other unexpected serious events**: 15 days

**IRB Reporting:**
- Per institutional policy
- Typically 5-10 days for serious unexpected events
- Some institutions require reporting within 24-48 hours

### MedDRA Coding

**MedDRA (Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities):**
- Standardized medical terminology for regulatory communication
- Hierarchical structure:
  - SOC (System Organ Class) - highest level
  - HLGT (High Level Group Term)
  - HLT (High Level Term)
  - PT (Preferred Term) - used for coding AEs
  - LLT (Lowest Level Term) - verbatim terms

**Example:**
- Verbatim term: "bad headache"
- LLT: Headache
- PT: Headache
- HLT: Headaches NEC
- HLGT: Neurological disorders NEC
- SOC: Nervous system disorders

### Causality Assessment Methods

**WHO-UMC Causality Categories:**
- **Certain**: Event cannot be explained by other factors
- **Probable/Likely**: Event more likely related to drug than other factors
- **Possible**: Event could be related to drug, but other factors cannot be ruled out
- **Unlikely**: Event likely explained by other factors
- **Conditional/Unclassified**: More data needed
- **Unassessable/Unclassifiable**: Information insufficient

**Naranjo Algorithm (for ADRs):**
Scoring system based on 10 questions:
- Score ≥9: Definite
- Score 5-8: Probable
- Score 1-4: Possible
- Score ≤0: Doubtful
